I was a heavy social media junkie back in the days when I used to work a lot for advertising agencies. And I also tend to do things extreme once I start with something.
The only way out of this addiction I found, was to delete the accounts when I realized it took too much of my daytime. And so I did with Facebook and also with Instagram.
But I never made this clean cut with twitter. And I guess I never will do. 

Twitter is like this shy, kind, silent guy in the class that nobody is aware of that will come to the school on a bright sunny day and kill the whole class.

Yep this is how I meanwhile see twitter.
